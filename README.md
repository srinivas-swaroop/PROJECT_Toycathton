## 🔍 Problem
Cultural education often lacks engagement and accessibility, especially when it comes to appreciating the historical and architectural significance of Indian monuments.

## 💡 Solution
We developed an **Augmented Reality (AR)** application that brings iconic Indian monuments to life through interactive 3D models and visual storytelling using **Unity** and **Vuforia**.

## 🎯 Impact
This immersive experience helps students, tourists, and culture enthusiasts explore Indian heritage in a meaningful and interactive way — enhancing learning beyond textbooks and photos.
